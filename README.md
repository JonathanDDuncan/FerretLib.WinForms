FerretLib.WinForms
=============

WinForms controls, helpers etc.

Will gradually move relevant code from individual projects to here. First up: TagList. A control intended for displaying and editing tag lists as commonly used for things like blog posts.

Current requirement is .Net Framework 3.5. I'll try to keep requirements to a minimum but can't see it going any lower than 3.5.

TODO:

* Allow duplicate tags
* Read-only mode (don't display tag input, process edit events etc)
* Autocomplete / tag suggestions

Maybe but unlikely:
* More UI polish
